algorithm for the second player’s move in a “1Player” game:

Objective:
- The goal is to simulate the second player’s turn in a Tic Tac Toe game when playing against the computer (AI).
Game Flow:
The game alternates between player 1 (human) and player 2 (computer).
When it’s player 2’s turn:
The computer identifies empty squares on the board.
It randomly selects one of the empty squares.
It places an “O” (computer’s symbol) in the chosen square.
The computer checks for a win condition (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
Algorithm Steps:
Initialize selectedSquare as null.
Create an empty array called emptySquares.
If the game type is “1Player” and it’s currently player 2’s turn:
Iterate through each item in itemIds (representing the game board squares).
If an item has an empty image source, add it to emptySquares.
If there are empty squares available:
Randomly select an index from emptySquares.
Set selectedSquare to the chosen square.
Set the image source of selectedSquare to “qrc:/o_img.png” (placing an “O” on the board).
Check for a win condition (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
Otherwise, log that no empty squares are available.
If it’s not player 2’s turn, log a message indicating that the computer should wait.
User Interaction:
The user interacts with the game by clicking on empty squares.
The computer’s move (player 2) is automatically triggered after a 1-second delay.
